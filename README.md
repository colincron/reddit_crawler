# reddit_crawler
A python web crawler that I wrote from scratch.


It starts at www.reddit.com and searches for href tags. It creates a file called tests.txt and appends all patterns matching /r/* to this file with no repetition.

To run, just install the requirements in requirements.txt and the command to run will be python3 main.py
